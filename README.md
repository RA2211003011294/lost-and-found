lost and found using python and sqlite

The Lost and Found System is a comprehensive software solution that 
simplifies the management of lost and found items in a variety of 
environments, including schools, offices, and public facilities. Users can 
effortlessly report lost items by inputting essential information such as 
the item's name, description, and the location where it was lost. The 
system automatically assigns a "Lost" status to newly reported items. 
Additionally, users can search for lost items by their name, allowing them 
to retrieve detailed information about the items, thus streamlining the 
process of recovering lost belongings. Furthermore, the system enables 
users to update the status of found items, marking them as "Found" and 
maintaining an organized record of all items, fostering transparency and 
efficient item tracking. 
By employing an SQLite database, the system ensures data persistence 
and efficient data retrieval. It offers advantages such as improved 
organization and user-friendliness, making it easier for users to report 
and retrieve lost items, as well as update the status of found items. 
However, it should be noted that the system lacks user authentication and 
may require periodic maintenance to ensure optimal database 
performance.
